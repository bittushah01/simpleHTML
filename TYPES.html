<h3><b>TYPES</b></h3>

<h4><b>On the basis of data handing capabilities</b>, the computer is of there types</h4>
<ol>
	<li><b>Analogue Computer</b>
	<ul>
		<li>An analogue computer consists of a collection of circuit modules capable of individually performing summation, scaling, integration or multiplication of voltages, and also function-generating modules. On the most up-to-date systems these modules contain integrated-circuit operational amplifiers and function generators. Several hundred amplifiers are likely to be used on a large analogue computer.

To solve a given problem in which the relationship of physical quantities varying with time can be expressed as differential equations, the inputs and outputs of appropriate modules are interconnected, incorporating scaling, feedback and setting of initial conditions as required, with voltages representing the physical quantities. In this way, single or simultaneous equations can be solved in such applications as engineering and scientific calculation, modelling and simulation.

The interconnection and setting of coefficients and initial conditions required is normally done by means of a patch panel and potentiometers. An analogue computer may also have a CRT display or chart recorder for the display or recording of the results of a computation. Where an analogue computer is being used for design work, the designer may choose to observe immediately the effect of changing a certain design parameter by varying the appropriate potentiometer setting, thus altering the voltage representing that parameter. In a simulation application, outputs from the analogue computer may be used as input voltages to another electrical system.

Except in some specialized areas, the work formerly done by analogue computers is now most likely to be carried out on the modern high-speed, cost-effective digital computer, using numerical methods for operations such as integration. Digital computers can work to high precision extremely accurately, whereas using analogue techniques, there are inherent limits to precision, and accuracy suffers through drift in amplifiers.

	<li><b>Digital Computer</b>
		<ul>
	<li>digital computer, any of a class of devices capable of solving problems by processing information in discrete form. It operates on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols, that are expressed in binary code—i.e., using only the two digits 0 and 1. By counting, comparing, and manipulating these digits or their combinations according to a set of instructions held in its memory, a digital computer can perform such tasks as to control industrial processes and regulate the operations of machines; analyze and organize vast amounts of business data; and simulate the behaviour of dynamic systems (e.g., global weather patterns and chemical reactions) in scientific research.

A brief treatment of digital computers follows. For full treatment, see computer science: Basic computer components.

      </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Hybrid Computer</b>
<ul>
	<li>A hybrid computer is a combined complex of several electronic computer units built using the different characterization of quantities (i.e., analog and digital features) and united by a single control system. The purpose of designing hybrid computers is to provide functions and features that can be found on both analog and digital devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>On the basis of size</b>, the computer can be of five types:</h4>
<ol>
	<li><b>Supercomputer</b>
		<ul>
			<li>supercomputer, any of a class of extremely powerful computers. The term is commonly applied to the fastest high-performance systems available at any given time. Such computers have been used primarily for scientific and engineering work requiring exceedingly high-speed computations. Common applications for supercomputers include testing mathematical models for complex physical phenomena or designs, such as climate and weather, evolution of the cosmos, nuclear weapons and reactors, new chemical compounds (especially for pharmaceutical purposes), and cryptology. As the cost of supercomputing declined in the 1990s, more businesses began to use supercomputers for market research and other business-related models.</li>

	</li>
	<li><b>Miniframe computer</b><ul>
		<li>a Miniframe computer is a small version of a Mainframe computer system (which would typically have thousands of Central Processing Units (CPUs) running in parallel).

Miniframe computers fill the gap in the market created by organisations that require a machine with more processing power than a typical desktop computer, but which don't need an entire room full of computers.
    </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Miniframe computer or Minicomputer</b>
		<ul>
			<li>A minicomputer is also known as mini. It is a class of small computers that was introduced into the world in the mid-1960s. A minicomputer is a computer which has all the features of a large size computer, but its size is smaller than those. A minicomputer lies between the mainframe and the microcomputer because its size is smaller than the former one and larger than the latter one. A minicomputer is also called as a mid-range computer. Minicomputers are mainly multi-users systems where more than one user can work simultaneously. Mini computer examples: IBM’s AS/400e, Honeywell200, TI-990.

Minicomputer can support multi-users at a time or you can say that minicomputer is a multiprocessing system. Also, the power of processing of minicomputers is not larger than the power of mainframe and supercomputers. These minicomputers can do time-sharing, batch processing, and online processing.</li>

	<li><b>Workstation</b>
		<ul>
			<li>A workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications.[1] Intended primarily to be used by a single user,[1] they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. The term workstation has also been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems,[2] Silicon Graphics, Apollo Computer,[3] DEC, HP, NeXT and IBM which opened the door for the 3D graphics animation revolution of the late 1990s.[4]

Workstations offer higher performance than mainstream personal computers, especially with respect to CPU and graphics, memory capacity, and multitasking capability. Workstations are optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulations (e.g., computational fluid dynamics), animation, and rendering of images, and mathematical plots. Typically, the form factor is that of a desktop computer, consists of a high resolution display, a keyboard and a mouse at a minimum, but also offers multiple displays, graphics tablets, 3D mice (devices for manipulating 3D objects and navigating scenes), etc. Workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories and collaboration tools.[4]

The increasing capabilities of mainstream PCs since the late 1990s have blurred the lines between PCs and technical/scientific workstations.[5] Typical workstations previously employed proprietary hardware which made them distinct from PCs; for instance IBM used RISC-based CPUs for its workstations and Intel x86 CPUs for its business/consumer PCs during the 1990s and 2000s. However, by the early 2000s this difference largely disappeared, as workstations now use highly commoditized hardware dominated by large PC vendors, such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard (later HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise) and Fujitsu, selling Microsoft Windows or Linux systems running on x86-64 processors.</li>

	<li><b>Microcomputer</b>
		<ul>
		<li>A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer having a central processing unit (CPU) made out of a microprocessor.[2] The computer also includes memory and input/output (I/O) circuitry together mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB)[3] Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). An early use of the term personal computer in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs. (See "Personal Computer: Computers at Companies" reference below). A microcomputer used as an embedded control system may have no human-readable input and output devices. "Personal computer" may be used generically or may denote an IBM PC compatible machine.</li>
