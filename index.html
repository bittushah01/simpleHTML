    <h3><b>ABOUT COMPUTER</b></h3>

    <P title="about computer">Computers are used in many fields like banking, medicine, finance and education with increased preference. With the growth of artificial intelligence, computers will soon blur lines between man and machine.

Under such circumstances, a rudimentary knowledge of computers is essential for everyday work. For those who are not yet familiar with computers, now is the time to gain knowledge about this field. As children will be living with this scenario in future, their employment capability will be tested against computers. To make them future-ready, it is essential to prepare them for this inevitability.

You may have been using your computer for ages without knowing what its essential components, history, or even computer definition are. But now with your children ready to take the next step into learning computers, you may be beset by various questions that you cannot seem to answer.</P>
<h4><b>Defination of a computer</b></h4>

<p> While you may have seen and used a computer but you may still be unable to answer what is computer correctly. There are many ways of defining a computer. The first and most standard definition is that a computer is something which computes or calculates. It is a machine that takes in raw data and performs some calculations on it and gives us the formed output in the desired format.Computer is also a device that stores as well as processes information electronically. Computers usually come in different sizes and grades of functionalities.</p>

<!--Types-->
<h3><b>TYPES</b></h3>

<h4><b>On the bais of data handing capabilities</b>, the coputer is of there types:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Analogue Computer</li>
	<li>Dgital Computer</li>
	<li>Hybrid Computer</li>
</ul>

   <h4><b>On the basis of size</b>, the computer can be of five types:</h4>
   <ul>
   	<li>Supercomputer</li>
   	<li>Mainiframe or microcomputer </li>
   	<li>Workstation<li/>
   <li>Microcomputer</li>
   </ul>

   <h3><b>USES OF COMPUTER</b></H3>
   	<P title="Uses of computer">The first electronic computers were used to perform difficult numerical calculations, but gradually they have come to take on much wider and more complicated roles. They now perform a diverse array of services and functions, and play a major role in most people's personal and professional lives.</P>

   	<!--Etymology-->
   	<h3><b>ETYMOLOGY</b></h3>
   <p title="Etymology">1640s, "one who calculates, a reckoner, one whose occupation is to make arithmetical calculations," agent noun from compute (v.).

Meaning "calculating machine" (of any type) is from 1897; in modern use, "programmable digital electronic device for performing mathematical or logical operations," 1945 under this name (the thing itself was described by 1937 in a theoretical sense as Turing machine). ENIAC (1946) usually is considered the first.

Computer literacy is recorded from 1970; an attempt to establish computerate (adjective, on model of literate) in this sense in the early 1980s didn't catch on. Computerese "the jargon of programmers" is from 1960, as are computerize and computerization.

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A New York Congressman says the use of computers to record personal data on individuals, such as their credit background, "is just frightening to me." [news article, March 17, 1968]
Earlier words for "one who calculates" include computator (c. 1600), from Latin computator; computist (late 14c.) "one skilled in calendrical or chronological reckoning."</p>
