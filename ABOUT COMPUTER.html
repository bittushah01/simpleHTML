<h3><b>ABOUT COMPUTER</b></h3>

<P title="about computer">From the software point of view, a computer is a six-level system consisting of the digital logic (collections of electronic gates), microarchitecture (a collection of functional units, such as ALUs - Arithmetic Logic Units, and their interconnectivity), instruction set architecture (the complete set of machine language instructions), operating system (code that monitors and controls the activities of the computer), assembly and machine language, and high-level language. The assembly language is very close to the machine language of a computer; it basically replaces the binary representation of machine instructions with mnemonics in a one-to-one fashion. From the hardware point of view, a computer is conveniently assumed to be a five-level hierarchy. The five levels correspond to network ports for connecting to the outside world (these ports may not be necessarily available, as a computer may be a standalone information processing and/or computing machine), peripheral or mass-storage devices for (applications and system) program and data storage, main memory, program and data caches (fast memories for retrieving data by content), and CPU (Central Processing Unit) or processor. Special emphasis is given in this article to the description of computer systems based on this five-level representation. Many other components are also included in computer systems in order to enable the aforementioned basic components to function properly. For example, control and data busses are used to transmit data between any two successive levels of the hardware hierarchy and glue logic is used to implement the appropriate interfaces. The design of a computer system most often begins with the selection of a particular CPU. The other components are selected progressively based on performance requirements. Analytical techniques, software simulations, and software or hardware prototyping of the complete or partial computer system are used to make final decisions about the design. Special attention is given nowadays to hardware-software codesign, where the selection or design of components is made in unison with the development of the corresponding system software.</P>

<h3><b>Characteristics</b></h3>

<p>A computer works with much higher speed and accuracy compared to humans while performing mathematical calculations. Computers can process millions (1,000,000) of instructions per second. The time taken by computers for their operations is microseconds and nanoseconds.</p>

<h3><b>Hardware Components</b></h3>

<p>Let's start with the computer case. This is the metal enclosure that contains many of the other hardware components. It comes in various shapes and sizes, but a typical tower model is between 15-25 inches high. Want to know what's inside? Okay, go get a screwdriver and let's open it up. Seriously, if you are really into computers, the best way to learn is to actually get hands-on. To save us some time, however, have a look at this desktop computer case. A computer enthusiast replaced the metal side panel with a transparent one, so we can have a look inside.

Although that photo looks pretty cool, it is a bit hard to recognize the individual components, especially with all the connecting wires running through it. This figure shows a more schematic version of a desktop computer, which makes it easier to point out the essential hardware components.
